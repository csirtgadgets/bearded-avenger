# Getting Started
### MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING ONE OF THE [RELEASES](/csirtgadgets/bearded-avenger/releases).
Releases are usually a little more stable than the master branch, in that *some* basic deployment testing for Ubuntu and CentOS has been performed using an SQLite backend.

## QuickStart
This assumes you have a proper Python dev already environment properly configured. If you need help getting started with this, checkout one of our [installation guides](https://github.com/csirtgadgets/bearded-avenger/wiki/Ubuntu14LTS).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/csirtgadgets/bearded-avenger.git
$ cd bearded-avenger
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py develop
$ mkdir -p log && cp hacking/develop.conf hacking/local.conf
$ cif-store -d --token-create-admin cif.yml
$ cif-store -d --token-create-hunter cif-router.yml
$ cif-store -d --token-create-smrt csirtg-smrt.yml
$ supervisord -c hacking/local.conf

# new window
$ cif --config cif.yml -p
$ csirtg-smrt --config csirtg-smrt.yml --test -r rules/default/csirtg.yml -d
$ cif --config cif.yml --itype ipv4
```
